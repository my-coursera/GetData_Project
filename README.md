This README file accompanies the code submitted as part of the Project of the Coursera course _Getting and Cleaning Data_ (Jan 2015). All the files are stored in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/my-coursera/GetData_Project).

The code is contained in two files, `read_data.R` and `run_analysis.R`. For the purposes of this
project, it will be assumed that these two files are placed and executed from the directory in which the data exists, and that the data was downloaded and extracted without any modification.

Details pertaining to the data and the operations performed theron are described in `CodeBook.md`, which is also available in this directory.

While `read_data.R`, as the name suggests, is used to read the data, execution begins with 
`run_analysis.R`.

The data set was downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
